# x-window-toggle
A simple bash tool to toggle window on and off, binding this to a keyboard shortcut can make any application like a quake terminal

## tdlr
```bash
# ensure you have the awesome `wmctrl` and `xdotool` installed
toggle.sh firefox
```

of `toggle.sh irefox` or even `toggle.sh FOX`

currently only works for single applications (if you have two `firefox` running this won't work)
